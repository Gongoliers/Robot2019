## [Library of Gongolierium](https://github.com/Gongoliers/Library-of-Gongolierium)
We utilize our in-house Library of Gongolierium to develop a more complex robot program much quicker.  Feel free to check out the library [here](https://github.com/Gongoliers/Library-of-Gongolierium) and take advantage of simple unit testing, higher level joysticks/controllers/sensors, built-in math functions, and easy to use motion profiling.  Check it out!

## Xbox Controller Mapping
The Gongoliers will be using two Xbox One controllers to drive and manipulate the 2019 robot.  One controller will be used for driving the chassis and another will be used for controlling the manipulators.
